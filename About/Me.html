    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hey, I'm <strong>DevXstyler</strong></p>
    <p>
      I'm just a guy who loves coding, especially creating stuff like Malware.
      I do not like the idea of real malware that harms people,
      what I like about malware is the challenge and the effects, the sounds and stuff a 
      good GDI malware can do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coding is fun but challenging. I often find myself unmotivated and stuck on problems.
      Nobody wants to have that, I know it and you know it.
      But it doesn't change that coding and creating is fun.
      I always was a person who enjoys to create stuff for others and not for myself.
      I just love to see what other people think and do. I love to see people appreciating my work.
      THAT is what keeps me going. Feedback is the only thing I need, even if its negative.
    </p>
    <br>

      <h3>The Leader</h3>
      I know people like to be the leader of projects and other stuff, and to be honest, I like that too.
      I just LOVE having the control over projets and things like that!
      <br>
      <br>
      Failing leads me to do nothing else than trying
      even harder.
      <br>
      <br>
      And succeeding just makes me UNBELIEVABLY happy!
      <br>

      I know it's kinda weird but I love beeing the leader because I know I am the person
      I can trust the most.

    <div class="timeline">
      <details open>
        <summary><span class="date">2019 - The beginning</span></summary>
        <p>The beginning, started coding with Scratch in school.
        <br>
        Back then I hated "coding" if the little stuff we did there can be called that.</p>
      </details>
      <details open>
        <summary><span class="date">2020 - Dead end</span></summary>
        <p>Our school sold the PCs we used and neither I nor my school continued.</p>
      </details>
      <details open>
        <summary><span class="date">2021 - Pause</span></summary>
        <p>Nothing new, we didn't get new PCs and I eventually completely forgot about Scratch.</p>
      </details>
      <details open>
        <summary><span class="date">2022 - Scratch is back</span></summary>
        <p>After switching schools some friends told me there was an IT club and even though
          it was meant for coding - they said you could do whatever you want.
          <br>
          So I joined and started playing games there.
          Eventually I got interested as one of my friends coded in Scratch. After years I actually saw
          this "thing" again and I instantly remembered it. I remembered how much
          fun elementary school was. So I started learning Scratch again, I did it for about 9 months until
          I found out about Python and started learning it.</p>
      </details>

        <summary><span class="date">2023 - Love on first sight</span></summary>
        <p>Fell in love with coding and technology. I didn't wanna do anything else.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details open>
        <summary><span class="date">2024 - Full time coder</span></summary>
        <p>I did Python for about a year and then I started with C++.
        <br>
        I loved how much faster it was and I started learning it. It was hardâ€¦
        But I NEVER gave up.

        <summary><span class="date">2025 - Birth of a new Developer</span></summary>
        <p>I am doing relatively hard projects including stuff like my own AIs and complicated software.
        <br>
          I also started other stuff like simple web development and some Lua.
