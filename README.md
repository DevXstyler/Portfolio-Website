### info:
Yes, for this readme and some CSS I did use ChatGPT, which may be kinda stupid but Instead of just vibe coding I am also
**Looking** at the code  to understand it. I didn't really learn JS (which you can also see under the skills tab) So I did also Use Gpt for the Glitchy text in my projects section.

I am often using AI because it **Helps**, I use it as a tool and not as a solution. Also often there are just no good tutorials on YouTube, good documentations or anything else. So I use ChatGPT's "Search" feature to get solutions on things I have no Idea how to implement.
This, again does not mean I am a vibe coder or have no real skills. I am still actively coding by myself and only rarely using ChatGPT for the hardest things.
